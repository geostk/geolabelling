Not clear whether this is referring to the same or a second figure. According to local information, there was a figure on the part of the N wall which has fallen; it may be buried beneath debris (Guest 1936, 114). No visible surface remains. In 1894 it was recorded that at Timahoe there was ?a grotesque figure requiring further inquiry? (Anon 1894, 393). In the same year it was recorded that at Timahoe Castle (LA018-031006-) there was ?a strange figure in stone, at the doorway of this castle. Its claim to admission in the list is open to doubt; but it is figured in a series of drawings belonging to the late Thomas Cooke, Esq., of Parsonstown, in 1870, and now owned by a gentleman in the south of Ireland, who kindly lent them to the writer? (Anon 1894, 80). In 1935 Guest wrote that ?it is not clear whether one figure is referred to, or two; none at all can now be seen. From personal information it appears that there was a figure on the part of the north wall that has now fallen, and it probably lies buried in the debris? (Guest 1936, 114) ",

It is recorded as being in the E gable by Killanin and Duignan (1967, 66). According to local information it was robbed about forty years ago, c. 1958. It is described by Guest (1936, 110) as being hidden by ivy and by Anderson (1977, 151) as missing. Anderson includes a 19th-century sketch by Westropp of the sheela-na-gig. From the sketch the carving appears to be quite naturalistic depicting a female form with a bald, oval head, eyes appear closed, slightly splayed nose and mouth and drooping breasts. There is a suggestion of ribs beneath the breasts. The arms are bent at the elbows, the sinister hand touching the oval vulva. The dexter hand holds the dexter thigh in a splayed position. The sinister leg is similarly in a splayed position. Both arms are in front of the legs. The feet are not clearly shown. The figure appears to be carved in relief on a rectangular block of stone, though the upper portion of the stone is obscured by ivy. Its current location is unknown. Location and co-ordinates given are for illustrative purposes only and are not accurate. Image courtesy of G. Cannon (http://www.irelands-sheelanagigs.org/). ",

Described by Weir (1980b, 63) as a 'pathetic figure rather crudely carved. An enormous head and spindly body make it look like an ice-cream cone. The legs are very slightly splayed, and the arms hang asymmetrically across the body, the right hand apparently holding the left wrist. The left hand, unusually pulls the large and pendent vulva from above. The breasts are tiny, round and asymmetrical, the eyes, nose and mouth are large. On the sides of the head and body are grooves.' Image courtesy of G. Cannon (http://www.irelands-sheelanagigs.org/). ",
