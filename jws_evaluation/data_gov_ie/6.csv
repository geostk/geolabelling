The motifs are concentrated on a slightly concave surface (over an area 0.6m x 0.6m), and consist of a number of cupmarks and three cup-and-ring motifs. The uppermost cup-and-ring motif consists of a central cupmark (5cm diameter) enclosed by two rings (external diameter of outer ring is 17cm), with a radial line (23cm) extending southward. 14cm beneath this motif, there are two conjoined cup-and-ring motifs. The more southerly motif consists of a central cupmark (5cm), enclosed by three rings (outer ring external diameter = 31cm), and possibly the arc of a fourth. Attached to its northern side is a larger cup-and-ring motif, with a central cupmark (5cm) enclosed by three rings and the arc of a fourth (minimum external diameter = 38cm), all of which respect the other cup-and-ring motif. To the naked eye there are around 8 cupmarks visible. However, the 3D models indicate a possible 18 cupmarks – two above and one below the radial of the upper motif, which also appears to have a further five possible cupmark just north of it; four along a ridge on the southern end of the decorated face; two above the smaller of the conjoined cup-and ring motifs, and possibly two between its first and second ring; one within the inner ring of the larger conjoined cup-and-ring motif, and another touching its third ring.

There are a number of large granite boulders placed in various points in the green areas of this estate, and it seems most likely that they were all found during the construction of the estate. Therefore, the rock art itself may have come from quite close to its present location. The general aspect here is of a S-facing slope with good commanding views S, towards Slieveboy in Co. Wexford. The granite boulder (dims. L 1.6m; Wth 1m; T 0.8m) is now placed on its edge, with the decorated side now on a vertical face, but originally the stone was most likely positioned so that the decoration occurred on the upper horizontal surface of the stone. The stone was probably formerly earthfast, and plough marks that score the edge of the decorated surface suggest that only a small portion of the boulder originally protruded above the ground surface. Most of the decoration occurs on a relatively flat face. There are two double ring and cup motifs (cup diams. 5cms; D 1.5 - 2cm; enclosing rings ext. diams 12cm and 18cm). There is another cup with traces of a ring (ext. diam. 20cm across) but it is unclear if there is also an inner circle in this case. There are also some six cup marks scattered across this face, while the surface of the stone rises above the flat surface at one side, and there are two further cups on this ridge.

",,"This large granite boulder (1.2m long x 0.83m wide x 0.84m thick), has frequent mica inclusions. There are signs of quarrying damage along the upper edge of the motif, part of which is missing. There is additional damage to the art, consisting of two broken linear grooves that cut through the outer two loops of the motif.",,"The Hollywood Stone is decorated with a large labyrinth motif (0.7m x 0.7m), consisting of a central cruciform shape enclosed by 8 incised lines to form 7 loops/returns of the labyrinth. While in the past some have assigned this boulder a prehistoric date, the style in which the labyrinth is executed (incised), the absence of a central cupmark, and its location close to the pilgrimage route of Glendalough, suggests that it is of later date. The labyrinth motif is often used to depict pilgrimage.

Wicklow. It was lying face down at the edge of a grassy lane at Lockstown Upper (WI016-017----). It consists of a boulder (dims. c. 1.2m by 0.9m and 0.8m thick) carved with a labyrinth design (diam. c. 0.7m). A small section of the labyrinth is missing where a section was broken from the stone: this had been done prior to its discovery. The labyrinth appears to have been carved using the classical seed pattern and it is not known which way the labyrinth was intended to be viewed though it seems probable that it may been positioned so that its opening was at the bottom. The exact purpose of this stone is unknown though it seems likely that it had some connection with the pilgrimage to Glendalough and may have been used as a marker or station along the route where pilgrims stopped to pray. The labyrinth design has been replicated as a landscape feature in front of the Visitor Centre. (Orpen 1911; Price and Walshe 1933, 48) ",

Since the carving of its cupmarks it has been reused as a window sill, and finally as a grave marker.",,"The stone is currently in an upright position with cupmarks visible on its two main faces. There are five cupmarks on its east-facing side, one of which has been carved completely through to the other side to produce a hole. On this side also there is a rectangular shaped reduction on the lower left side of this face, which indicates its reuse as a window sill. Above this recess there are the remains of another two cupmarks, which have been damaged where the stone has broken away. These partial cupmarks are mirrored by another two cupmarks on the west-facing side, which also has six further cupmarks, along with the circular hole shared with the other side. The largest cupmark (6cm diam., 4cm deep) is located on the west-facing side; the rest of the cupmarks on both sides are between 3- 4.5cm in diameter and 0.5-2.5cm deep.",,http://wicklowrockartproject.com/listing/ballintemple-wi040-0011006/,,http://wicklowrockartproject.com/listing/ballintemple-wi040-0011006/,,,,717419,,677337,,"In the E end of Ballintemple graveyard (WI040-011003-). It is set upright and appears to have been reused as a headstone. Consists of a shale pillar-like stone (L 0.75m; Wth 0.29m; T 0.09m) with one end of the stone decorated with a series of cupmarks on both faces. On one face are nine cup marks ranging from 2cm to 5cm across and 0.5cm to 2.5cm deep; the largest of these appears to cut the edge of a small cup. One edge of the stone has been broken away so that two of the cups are now on the edge of the stone and only survive partially. Notably, these two cups appear to have met a pair of cupmarks on the opposite face. On this face are seven cups. It is also notable that two of the other cups appear to be directly opposite cupmarks on the other face. In one corner a hole extends through the thickness of the stone. It appears that this was formed where cupmarks on either side have met and broken through the thickness of the stone. The stone was clearly reused afterwards as a window sill; the plunging internal and external bases of the window have been finely carved near the centre of the stone. This window was some 31.5cm wide. The external splay measures 43cm across. ",

It has five visible faces. Its decorated west-facing side is slightly concave, and there appears to be angular stone extractions in this side and the east-facing side. There are possible plough marks on the lower part of the east-facing side.

There are also another three cupmarks closer to the the base, which may form part of another row.

Smaller cupmarks are present to the south of this concentration and along the edge closest to the ground surface. On the flattened northern face there is a large cupmark (12cm in diameter, 4cm deep), which has been interpreted as a bullaun. However, there are other rock art sites (e.g. Baltynanima WI018-036) with large cupmarks at the centre of cup-and-ring motifs. As such the bullaun at Ticlash could be a similar large prehistoric cupmark.
